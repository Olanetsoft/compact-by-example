## Welcome to Compact by Example

Learn **[Midnight Network's](https://midnight.network)** Compact language through practical, runnable code examples. This guide provides a hands-on approach to mastering smart contract development for privacy-preserving applications on the Midnight blockchain.

Inspired by the acclaimed "Solidity by Example," this resource is designed to help developers of all levels understand Compact's unique features and capabilities.

## What is Compact?

**Compact** is Midnight Network's smart contract programming language that enables you to write privacy-preserving decentralized applications. The Compact compiler outputs **zero-knowledge circuits** that prove the correctness of interactions with the blockchain ledger.

### Key Concepts

**Ledger State**: Smart contracts store data on-chain using `ledger` declarations. This state is publicly accessible but can contain commitments and hashes that preserve privacy.

**Circuits**: The main functions of your contract. Exported circuits become entry points that users can call in transactions. All circuit computations are proven correct using zero-knowledge proofs.

**Witnesses**: Functions that retrieve data from the user's local machine (like secret keys). Witness data is kept confidential and never revealed on-chain.

**Privacy by Design**: Data not stored in ledger fields or returned from circuits remains confidential. Compact uses hashing and commitment schemes to enable proving correctness without revealing sensitive information.

### What You Can Build

- **Confidential Transactions**: Financial applications that hide transaction details while proving validity
- **Private Voting Systems**: DAOs with confidential voting that prevents voter tracking
- **Shielded Assets**: NFTs and tokens with private ownership and metadata
- **Compliant Privacy**: Systems that prove regulatory compliance without exposing private data
