description: Get your Midnight development environment running to set up tools, configure wallets, and deploy your first zero-knowledge application.
---

## Overview

Get started with Midnight development by setting up the Lace wallet, obtaining test tokens, and installing the Compact compiler. You'll also configure Docker for running the zero-knowledge proof server.

**What You'll Install:**

- **Lace Wallet**: Chrome extension for managing Midnight assets and signing transactions
- **Compact Compiler**: Converts your `.compact` contracts into zero-knowledge circuits
- **Docker Proof Server**: Generates cryptographic proofs for contract execution
- **Development Tools**: VS Code extension and Node.js SDK for testing

<Note>
  **About Compact**: Compact is Midnight's smart contract language. It compiles
  to zero-knowledge circuits that prove computation correctness without
  revealing private data. All contract logic runs in circuits, and sensitive
  data can be kept local using witness functions.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Google Chrome browser installed
- Basic familiarity with command-line operations
- Administrative privileges on your computer (for installing Docker and Compact)

## Install the Lace Midnight Preview wallet

### 1. Download and install the Lace wallet extension

Lace Midnight Preview wallet is a browser extension wallet for the Midnight network. It is currently only compatible with Google Chrome.

1. **Open the Google Chrome browser** - Launch Chrome on your computer.

2. **Install the Lace wallet extension** - Visit the Chrome Web Store: [Lace Beta Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-beta/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg)

3. **Add to Chrome** - Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm by clicking **Add extension**.

4. **Pin the extension** - Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access (recommended).

**Verification**: The Lace wallet icon appears in your Chrome toolbar.

### 2. Create your wallet

Your wallet is protected by a seed phrase, which acts as your master key. Keep it secret and safe.

1. **Open Lace wallet** - Click the Lace wallet icon in your toolbar.

2. **Create new wallet** - Select **Create a new wallet**.

3. **Set password** - Choose a strong password.

4. **Save seed phrase** - **Crucially**: Write down your seed phrase on paper and store it in a secure, offline location. Never store it digitally or share it.

5. **Confirm seed phrase** - Confirm your seed phrase to complete the setup.

**Verification**: Your wallet dashboard opens, showing a `0` tDUST balance.

### 3. Get test tokens (tDUST)

tDUST is the token used on the Midnight Testnet. It has no real-world value and is used for testing transactions and interacting with applications.

1. **Copy wallet address** - In your Lace wallet, click **Receive** and copy your wallet address.

2. **Visit the faucet** - Go to the Testnet Faucet: [https://midnight.network/test-faucet/](https://midnight.network/test-faucet/)

3. **Request tokens** - Paste your address into the form and click **Request tDUST**.

4. **Wait for confirmation** - Wait a few minutes for the tokens to arrive.

**Verification**: Your Lace wallet shows a new balance of tDUST tokens.

You are now ready to interact with DApps. To start building on Midnight, continue with these additional setup steps for the development environment.

## Install Compact

### 4. Install Compact using the installer script

[Compact](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact) is Midnight's dedicated smart contract language for creating applications (DApps) that allow developers to express the amount of data protection that works for them.

Use the following command to install the pre-built binaries:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/download/compact-v0.2.0/compact-installer.sh | sh
```

### 5. Update your shell PATH

Make sure the Compact binary is in your shell's `PATH` to run it from any directory. Your shell needs to be updated after installation.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bash">
    ```bash
    # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
    export PATH="$HOME/.compact/bin:$PATH"
    
    # Reload shell configuration
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  </Tab>

{" "}
<Tab title="Zsh">
  ```bash # Add to ~/.zshrc export PATH="$HOME/.compact/bin:$PATH" # Reload
  shell configuration source ~/.zshrc ```
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Fish">
    ```bash
    # Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    set -gx PATH $HOME/.compact/bin $PATH
    
    # Reload shell configuration
    source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 6. Verify the Compact installation

Run the following commands to verify your installation:

```bash
compact --version # print version of Compact
which compact     # print installation path
```

**Verification**: These commands return the Compact version number and installation path.

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting Compact Installation">
  If you encounter issues: - **Command not found**: Ensure the PATH is correctly
  set and the shell configuration is reloaded - **Permission denied**: Run the
  installer with appropriate permissions or contact your system administrator -
  **Network issues**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings Visit
  the [Compact GitHub repository](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact) for
  more help.
</Accordion>

## Set up the proof server

### 7. Install Docker Desktop

The proof server is required to generate zero-knowledge proofs for transactions locally. It runs as a background service using Docker.

If you don't have Docker, download and install Docker for your operating system:

After installation, verify Docker is running:

```bash
docker --version
docker ps
```

### 8. Run the proof server

Use the following command to start the proof-server in your terminal:

```bash
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'
```

<Warning>
  This command occupies the terminal window while running. Keep this terminal
  open when developing Compact applications.
</Warning>

**Verification**: The terminal displays logs indicating the server is running and listening at `http://localhost:6300`.

<Note>
  To use a local proof-server with Lace Midnight Preview wallet, go to
  **Settings** > **Midnight** and select `Local (http://localhost:6300)`.
</Note>

## Install Compact VS Code extension

### 9. Download the Compact VS Code extension

The Compact VS Code extension provides helpful syntax highlighting, code snippets, and IntelliSense for Compact development.

1. **Download the extension** - Get the latest VSIX package from the [official releases page](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases).

2. **Install in VS Code** - In VS Code, go to **Extensions** → Click the `...` menu → Select **Install from VSIX** → Choose the downloaded file.

3. **Reload VS Code** - Reload the window when prompted to activate the extension.

**Verification**: You now see **Compact Language Support** extension in your installed VS Code extensions.

<Accordion title="Alternative: Manual Installation via Command Line">
  You can also install the extension using the VS Code command line: ```bash
  code --install-extension /path/to/compact-language-support.vsix ```
</Accordion>

## Verify your complete setup

Run through this quick checklist to ensure everything is configured correctly:

1. **Check Lace wallet** - ✅ Lace wallet installed and funded with tDUST tokens

2. **Check Compact compiler** - Run the following command:

   ```bash
   compact --version
   ```

   ✅ Should display the installed Compact compiler version (e.g., 0.2.0 or higher)

3. **Check Docker** - Verify Docker is running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   ✅ Should show proof-server container running (if started)

4. **Check VS Code extension** - ✅ Create a test `.compact` file and verify syntax highlighting works
